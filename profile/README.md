***We are a forward-thinking organization dedicated to exploring the limitless boundaries of technological innovation,
empowered by our passion for experimentative approach, blending engineering excellence with a research-driven mindset.
As Prospect Laboratories Organization, our mission is to empower us humans through the vastly expanding world of
technology.***

### About us
In our early days, Prospect Laboratories operated like a true research laboratory. testing ideas, building prototypes, and
refining engineering practices. Our first steps were in 2022, creating experimental web applications and services to make
our daily jobs and fragments of work easier. As the projects were expanding and seeing success in them, we decided to
continue the development of those products. In 2024, our organization went under a huge change, we've decided to lean to
Embedded Systems and Software Engineering. In 2025, we've decided to completely go open-source, rewriting our code to be
much more robust, readable and performant and releasing them to the world one by one.

### Why do we exist?
Software shapes the future, and we believe its creators deserve environments where innovation can thrive. Prospect
Laboratories Organization exists to cultivate that environment; a place where experimentation is celebrated, insights
are shared freely and impactful ideas can grow from concept to reality.
