# Contribution Policies
We have certain policies about contribution. Please take note that these policies are mandatory.
1. **Overall or excessive use of Artifical Intelligence software and work; including LLMs, LCMs, SAMs, LAMs, MLMs and VLMs are completely prohibited.** This means that you cannot vibe-code and you cannot ask AI for help when you are stuck somewhere during development. This will drastically affect the codebase and overall performance.[^1]
2. **Overall or excessive implementation of Artifical Intelligence Models and Systems are completely prohibited.** This means that you cannot deploy an AIM/AIS inside any of our services or works. However you can create projects and/or libraries that are tools (ex. Visual Recognition Software, Voice Recognition Software, Personal or Management Assistant etc.) and you must use Open-Source Data models that are trained on Open-Source works.[^1]
3. **Do not use any derogatory, offensive or vulgar works in your commit contents and commit messages.**[^1]
4. **You (as a personal user, company or a corporation entity) are obliged to stay in the boundaries of our licenses.** You are also obliged to not use any copyrighted material in any of our works, including our future works as well.[^1]
