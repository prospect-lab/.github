# Prospect Laboratories Organization

### About us
We are a forward-thinking organization dedicated to exploring the limitless boundaries of technological innovation,
empowered by our passion for experimentative approach, blending engineering excellence with a research-driven mindset.
As Prospect Laboratories Organization, our mission is to empower us humans through the vastly expanding world of
technology.

In our early days, Prospect Laboratories operated like a true research laboratory. testing ideas, building prototypes,
and refining engineering practices. Our first steps were in 2022, creating experimental web applications and services
to make our daily jobs and fragments of work easier. As the projects were expanding and seeing success in them, we
decided to continue the development of those products. In 2024, our organization went under a huge change, we've
decided to lean to Embedded Systems and Software Engineering. In 2025, we've decided to completely go open-source,
rewriting our code to be much more robust, readable and performant and releasing them to the world one by one.
